This is a lovely plate was designed by Phil Burgess for the Beagle Bone. Thin lines are cut from 3mm thick acrylic in any color. Fills are rastered on (optional. Also requires 4 plastic standoffs, 4 hexnuts, and 4 1/2" screws. 4-40 or M3 work well.

Ready to prototype your next [Beagle Bone](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1278) project? You'll certainly want this handy Proto-Plate! Not only is it really good looking, its also very useful, holding your [Beagle Bone or Beagle Bone Black](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1278) steady alongside a standard [half-sized breadboard](http://www.adafruit.com/products/64).

New! As of May 7, 2013 this plate has ben re-designed to fit either an original Beagle Bone or the new Beagle Bone Black (with a cut-out for the HDMI port cable) We also updated the design so the 'Bone can be placed 'either way' in case you want the P8 or P9 header closer to the breadboard.

The plate is made of 3mm thick laser-cut clear acrylic with nice engraving showing alignment. There are four 4-40 screws, standoffs and hex-nuts to attach the 'Bone on and the halfsized breadboard can be stuck on (just remove the paper backing from it). Finally, there are four rubber bumpers you can use to lift the plate off of your table, so it won't slide around.

[BeagleBone](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1278) and [half-sized breadboard](http://www.adafruit.com/products/64) are not included! [You can pick those items (as well as other Beagle Bone toys in the shop](http://www.adafruit.com/category/75).
